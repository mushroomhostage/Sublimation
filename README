Sublimation - ice vaporizes in The Nether

Makes ice behave realistically in The Nether. When placed, it will turn into smoke,
just like emptying a bucket of water.

=== Permissions
sublimation.bypass (false) - Allows you to place ice in the nether 

=== Configuration
consume (true)
    If true, turns placed ice into air, removing from the player's inventory
    If false, cancels event, giving the player their ice back

smoke (true)
    Generate smoke particles, representing the sublimated ice

=== Notes
Works great with ChangeSilkTouch to restore the behavior of 1.9 prereleases
(get ice with the silk touch enchantment), without the abuse possible by
placing ice and breaking it to get water in The Nether.
